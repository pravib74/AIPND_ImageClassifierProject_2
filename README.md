# AIPND_ImageClassifierProject_2
This is a project done for udacity AI WITH PYTHON PROGRAMMING course.
Project aim is to use a pretrained ined network like vgg19 to classify flowers.
Using pretrained build classifier, train the classifier, validate the accuracy, Fino utility trading loss.
Once trained use test data to test.
A predict function is developed to predict input image class and its probability.
1.imageclassier jupiter notebook
2.train.py - trains the model
3.predict.py - predicts the input image
4.get_input_args.py - for praising input
5.cat_to_name.json - original class lables
6.work_utilities.py - provided by udacity useful for keeping workspace awake when training for long
